# Pep bot: A cheerful chat companion

This is a bot that asks about the user's mood and offers different activities based on it. 

It was made to practice DOM manipulation, variables, basic functions, conditionals, event listeners, and the dynamic generation of HTML on a chat window. 

## Features

* Start button to trigger the conversation
* Elements generated dynamically: Chat bubbles and text, buttons, drop-down menu. 
* Four different moods offering different activities 
* Event listeners for buttons, drop-down menu, and input text

## Production process

* Initially attempting to reproduce the bot presented in the course material, with a generic "nextQuestion" function that handled all answer functions in one 
* Later decided to use an individual approach to each answer function, presenting them in a chronological top-to-bottom sequence
